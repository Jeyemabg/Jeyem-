      <p>Hello! My name is Jhon Marck Abugao, but I like to be called Jeyem.</p>
      <p>I am a simple and kind person. Most of the time, I am quiet and I don’t really talk much, especially when I’m with people I don’t know well. I may look shy, but once you get to know me, I can be friendly too. I enjoy spending time alone or with a few close friends rather than being in big groups.</p>
      <p>I really love sports. I enjoy playing many different kinds of sports, but my favorite is calisthenics. It is a kind of workout that uses your own body weight to build strength and skill. I like it because it helps me get stronger and move better without using heavy gym equipment. It also helps me stay focused and disciplined.</p>
      <p>Aside from sports, I also enjoy music. I like listening to different kinds of songs, depending on how I feel. Music helps me relax and feel better when I’m tired or stressed.</p>
      <p>Another thing I love is watching anime and movies. I don’t just watch anything—I only watch shows that I really like. I enjoy stories that have strong characters, good action, or deep meaning. Watching anime and movies also helps me learn new things and imagine different worlds.</p>
      <p>Even though I may not talk a lot, I have many interests and dreams. I always try to be a better version of myself every day. I believe that with patience, hard work, and a positive attitude, I can reach my goals in life.</p>
      <p>Thank you for listening. I’m happy to share a little about myself!</p>
